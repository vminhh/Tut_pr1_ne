Create a text file which contains several English paragraph and fill it with some content that you can find.
In the file, there should be words that a duplicated. Write a program to read the content of this text file and prints out a vocabulary of all the words in the text, without duplicates.
Your program should be case-insensitive, which means the two strings "Hello" and "hello" should be considered the same word.
Hint
You should use String.split() method to split the text content into words.
You should also convert everything into lowercase (or uppercase) to make your program case-insensitive.
